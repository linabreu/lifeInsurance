Program uses methods to computes annual insurance policy premiums based on the age of the user

How It Works:

The fictitious insurance company that this program is for computes the annual policy premiums based on the age of the customer. The premium is computed by taking the decade of the customer's age, adding 15 to it, and multiplying by 20 (i.e. a 34-year-old would pay $360, which is calculated by adding the decades (3) to 15, and then multiplying by 20). Probably not how insurance is calculated in the real world but we will go with it for the sake of this program!

Program uses methods to break up the work and implements a method outside of the method called getPrem which does the calculations and then returns the value.
